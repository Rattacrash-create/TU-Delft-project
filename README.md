Python script used in WP 2 for the design of the propulsion subsystem. 
What it does:
- evaluate the transfer module and orbiter propellant and tank masses
- simulate the circularization maneuver (iterating through the subsequent orbits)
- calculate tank structure (size and wall thickness) for both designs
- show orbits in a graph and print all relevant system characteristics
